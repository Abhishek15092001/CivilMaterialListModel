Plumbing Material List Calculator using Machine Learning
Overview:

The Plumbing Material List Calculator is a machine learning model designed to automate the generation of material lists for plumbing projects. Instead of manually estimating and calculating the required materials, this model predicts the necessary components based on various project parameters. It simplifies the planning process, reduces errors, and enhances efficiency in plumbing projects.
Key Features:

    Predictive Material Estimation: The model utilizes historical data and patterns to predict the quantity and type of materials needed for a plumbing project. This includes pipes, fittings, fixtures, and other relevant components.

    Project Customization: Users can input specific details about their plumbing project, such as the type of installation (e.g., residential, commercial), dimensions, and any unique requirements. The model takes these inputs into account to provide accurate material recommendations.

    Cost Estimation: Alongside material predictions, the model can provide an estimated cost for the required plumbing materials, helping users budget effectively for their projects.

    ## Features

- **Material Estimation:** The model uses machine learning algorithms to estimate the quantity of various plumbing materials required for a given project.

- **Accuracy Improvement:** Continuously trained and fine-tuned to improve accuracy based on real-world data and user feedback.

- **Input Flexibility:** Accepts a variety of input parameters such as project dimensions, fixture types, and specific requirements.
